# Hilbert’s Webcam

**Hilbert’s Webcam** is an immersive exploration of fractal geometry and real-time video, blending ephemeral camera signals with the endless recursion of the Hilbert curve. At every instant, a fleeting moment of light becomes a doorway to intricate, ever-evolving patterns traced out by the fractal algorithm. The result is a living tapestry of luminous lines, one that transforms each shift in brightness into a visual labyrinth of complexity.

## The Power of AI in Creation

This project is more than just code—it is a testament to the extraordinary synergy between human creativity and artificial intelligence. The implementation of **Hilbert’s Webcam** would not have been possible without the advancements in AI and large language models, which have enabled a new way of conceptualizing, refining, and expanding ideas. 

I am deeply excited about the vast possibilities that lie ahead. With these tools, we are no longer bound by the limits of our individual expertise; instead, we stand at the threshold of an era where innovation is amplified, and imagination takes new form. This is just the beginning of what we can create.

## How to Use

1. Visit **[Hilbert’s Webcam](https://alejandroromerog.github.io/LiveHilbertCurves/)**.
2. Allow camera access when prompted.
3. Adjust the **Brightness** slider to filter which pixels contribute to the fractal.
4. Modify the Curve **Complexity** slider to explore different recursion depths of the Hilbert curve.
5. Click the fractal area to save a high-resolution snapshot.
