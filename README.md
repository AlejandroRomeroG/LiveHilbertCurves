# Hilbert’s Webcam

**Hilbert’s Webcam** is an immersive exploration of fractal geometry and real-time video, blending ephemeral camera signals with the endless recursion of the Hilbert curve. At every instant, a fleeting moment of light becomes a doorway to intricate, ever-evolving patterns traced out by the fractal algorithm. The result is a living tapestry of luminous lines, one that transforms each shift in brightness into a visual labyrinth of complexity.
